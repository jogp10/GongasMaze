When trying to write a new register into the leaderboard and put it in order, we had some troubles.
We understood we couldn't write in a midle of a file, so we had to get around it. How?
We wrote the record in the last line of the file, after we read the file and we used a dynamic vector to store the lines,
We put the records in order, and we wrote again all the lines into the file.

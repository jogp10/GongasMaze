Gongas is trapped into a maze and he really needs your help in order to escape!
The task isn't easy though...

He is surrounded by the security guards of The Dark Empire. This evil 
organisation is trying to convert all Humans to Zombies and only Gongas can 
save everyone.  

Here are some rules and details you must follow to assist him: 

1) The Maze Gongas is placed in is made up of high-voltage fences and posts. If
you happen to bump him against any of those he instantly dies and as you may
assume the human race will be forever extinct... but donÂ´t worry, the Guards will 
equally die if they collide in them and that is precisely what you should attempt
to induce; 

2) The security guards can't literally see Gongas because they don't have any 
vision sensors, but what they do have is an extremely sensitive odour sensor 
which allows them to follow Gongas very accurately. Each step he takes, each step
they take closer to him. Choose wisely! ;
